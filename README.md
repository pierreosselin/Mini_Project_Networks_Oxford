# Mini_Project_Networks_Oxford
The objective of this project is to study the apparent lack of performance of spectral clustering methods for sparse networks,.
and to implement a new spectral method based on an other operator, called the non-backtracking matrix to overcome this difficulty.

# Results
Results of our methods (Non-backtracking, Reluctant methods) compared to the classic spectral methods based on the Laplacian Matrix with the stochastic block model. Here there are two groups in the networks, cin corresponds to the mean internals in-degrees, cout to the inter-group mean degrees. In our case when the two groups are hard to distinguish in a sparse setting the non-backtracking and reluctant operators perform better.
