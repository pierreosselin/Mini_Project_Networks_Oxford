# Mini_Project_Networks_Oxford
The objective of this project is to study the apparent lack of performance of spectral clustering methods for sparse networks,.
and to implement a new spectral method based on an other operator, called the non-backtracking matrix to overcome this difficulty.

# Results
Results of our methods (Non-backtracking, Reluctant methods) compared to the classic spectral methods based on the Laplacian Matrix with the stochastic block model.
